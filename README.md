## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Data Science undergraduate at UC Berkeley** with a strong interest in  
**AI agents, backend systems, and production-ready machine learning pipelines**.

I enjoy breaking down complex problems and rebuilding them into **modular, scalable systems** —  
from **multi-agent architectures** to **ML models with real-world interpretability**.

Currently focused on:
- 🤝 **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems**
- ⚙️ **Backend APIs & Microservices**
- ☁️ **Cloud-native ML systems (AWS)**
- 📊 **Data-driven decision making**

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🔗 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Multi-Agent System
**Dec 2025 – Jan 2026**

A distributed multi-agent AI system that enables autonomous agent discovery, communication, and task delegation using a standardized protocol.

**Highlights**
- Designed a **LangGraph-based reasoning agent** exposed via **FastAPI**
- Implemented **JSON-RPC 2.0** for structured agent-to-agent communication
- Introduced an **Agent Card (JSON)** format for agent metadata & capability discovery
- Built a user-facing orchestration agent to dynamically route tasks and aggregate responses
- Applied **microservices architecture principles** for modular and extensible agent design

**Tech:**  
`Python` `FastAPI` `LangGraph` `LangChain` `JSON-RPC` `Microservices`

**June 2025**

Machine learning project predicting hourly bike rental demand for Seoul’s bike-sharing system.

**Highlights**
- Built models using **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**
- Performed extensive **EDA & feature engineering**
- Achieved **MAE 962.43 / RMSE 1610.30**
- Used **SHAP** to interpret predictions and identify key demand drivers

**Tech:**  
`Python` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn` `XGBoost` `SHAP`
